# Label Atom

A Label component, htmlFor should be the ID of the field that the label is for. 

## How to use

For accessibility an implicit label is not recommended, always use an explicit label. This is because not all accessibility devices support implict labels, and it is also semantically wrong - the wrapped field is not part of the label.

```javascript
/* Implicit label (this is wrong!) */
<Label htmlFor="field-1">
  <input type="text" id="field-1">
  A label
</Label>

/* Explicit label (use this form where possible) */
<Label htmlFor="field-1">A label</Label>
<input type="text" id="field-1">
```
