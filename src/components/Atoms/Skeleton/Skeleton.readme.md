## Skeleton Items

Skeleton items can be used as quick drop-in components for implementing loading UI-state. They are meant to provide basic abstrations for inline and block-elements, allowing for simple conditional display.

### Skeleton Block Item

Renders the skeleton animation into a block-element. Width and height can be specified.

### Skeleton Inline Item

Renders an inline element that shares similar properties with the `Typo`-component. This allows to represent different font-sizes and line-heights.
A newline can be forced, by setting the `newLine`-prop.
