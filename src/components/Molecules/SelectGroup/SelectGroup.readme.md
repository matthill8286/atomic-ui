## SelectGroup atom

Use selection groups like checkboxes or radio buttons when you have to present lots of information to the user.

### State

Default: In the default state the border is grey with the MediaMarkt black as the font-color.
Unselected: When one tile is selectd the other ones turn into the unselected state. The text color changes to a slightly lighter grey to diferentiate between selected and unselected.
Selected: When a tile gets selectd the state transitions to a red outline card with a slight shadow. The text-color stays in the MediaMarkt black.

#### #### Changes

Added the `elevation` and `elevationHover` props.
